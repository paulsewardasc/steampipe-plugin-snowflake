## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install snowflake
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  name,
  email,
  disabled,
  last_success_login
from
  snowflake_user
where
  (last_success_login > now() - interval '30 days')
  and last_success_login is not null;
```
## Examples

```sql
select account as "Account",
    name as "Warehouse",
    credit_quota as "Credit Quota",
    used_credits as "Used Credits",
    remaining_credits as "Remaining Credits",
    to_char(used_credits/credit_quota*100,'9990D9') as "% Used",
    case
        when used_credits/credit_quota*100 > 90 then 'alert'
        when used_credits/credit_quota*100 > 75 then 'warning'
        else 'ok'
    end as type
from snowflake_resource_monitor
where used_credits/credit_quota*100 > 75
order by used_credits/credit_quota desc
```

```sql
select account as "Account",
    name as "Warehouse"
from snowflake_resource_monitor
where remaining_credits < 1
```
